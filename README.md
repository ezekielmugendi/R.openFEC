# R.openFEC
## An R Wrapper for the Open FEC API
openFEC is an API developed by 18F with the intention of making campaign finance data more accessible to the public.
As described by the developers of the [project](https://github.com/18F/openFEC):
```
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) releases information to the public about
money that's raised and spent in federal elections â€” that's elections for US President,
Senate, and House of Representatives.

Are you interested in seeing how much money a candidate raised?
Or spent? How much debt they took on? Who contributed to their campaign?
The FEC is the authoritative source for that information.

The new FEC.gov is a collaboration between 18F and the FEC.
It aims to make campaign finance information more accessible (and understandable) to all users.
```
